## Project Name
EndPointDB
## About
EndPointDB is a Backend Specialization Final Forum Project deployed to Amazon Web Services (AWS). It is a robust forum application featuring a secure, scalable frontend, RESTful API, backend, and database. The project showcases advanced frontend and backend development with user registration, login, posts, replies, likes, JWT-based authentication, token validation, and password management via an auth controller. It includes authorization mechanisms, database seeding, and session management with cookies and local storage. Deployed using AWS Elastic Beanstalk, it leverages IAM for user permissions, EC2 with SSH access, RDS for relational database services, and Elastic Beanstalk extensions for streamlined deployments. The system is optimized with environment variables, load balancers, and HTTPS for secure, scalable performance. This led to the purchase of my first official domain, (Not Actual) Https://GuruCoding.com. I have added the frontend which is depicted here and fully integrates api endpoints for a completed full stack application.
## Prerequisites

**The Source Code is available upon request and is not open to public**

To run this project, you need the following installed on your system:

-React

-Node.js and TypeScript (for the backend runtime and development environment, as the project uses TypeScript with Node.js).

-AWS CLI for interacting with AWS services like Elastic Beanstalk, RDS, and IAM.

-Docker (optional, for containerized deployment if utilized).

-A compatible database client (e.g., PostgreSQL for AWS RDS compatibility, as assumed for the database setup).

-TBD

-Note: Due to the complexity of this project, not all dependencies may work with your current versions. This is not an exhaustive prerequisite list and this is a very complicated project. The usage section is TBD as it requires extensive knowledge of navigating various complex components. 

## Features
The EndPointDB project includes these features:

-Frontend Client with fully functioning api endpoints

-User registration with secure password handling and auth controller.

-Issuing and validating JWT tokens for authentication.

-Authorization mechanisms to control access.

-Database seeding for initial data population.

-Use of cookies and local storage for managing user sessions.

-Integration with AWS IAM for users and permissions.

-Elastic Beanstalk client interface for streamlined deployments.

-Connecting to EC2 instances via SSH.

-Management of environment variables for configuration.

-Working with RDS for relational database services.

-Building with Elastic Beanstalk extensions.

-Load balancers and HTTPS setup for secure, scalable traffic handling.

## Getting Started & Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
`git clone https://github.com/NickAlvarez20/EndPoint.git`

1. Navigate to the project directory:
`cd projectDir`
2. Install dependencies (assuming Node.js/Express.js as an example):
`npm install`

3. Configure environment variables (e.g., in a .env file) for AWS credentials, database connections, JWT, etc.

4. Seed the database if necessary using provided scripts.

5. Deploy to AWS Elastic Beanstalk using the AWS CLI or console.

## Usage
TBD

## Learning Outcomes
This project helped me:

-Learn how to connect a frontend to an api/backend/database and make requests

-Implement user registration, JWT issuance, token validation, and password management.

-Develop authentication and authorization using controllers.

-Seed databases and manage sessions with cookies and local storage.

-Work with AWS IAM for users and permissions.

-Utilize Elastic Beanstalk for client interfaces and easy deployments.

-Connect to EC2 via SSH and handle environment variables.

-Integrate with RDS for database operations.

-Build applications using Elastic Beanstalk extensions.

-Configure load balancers and HTTPS for secure scaling.

Enhance skills in debugging, testing, and optimizing backend systems.
